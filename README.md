Proteins are strings of amino acids. The spatial conformation of these chains is of utmost importance for a protein's functioning in biological processes.
It is known that hydrophobic amino acids (H) and cysteine amino acids (C) prefer proximity to one another. Such is not the case for polar amino acids (P). Two adjacent H's, two C's, or a C and an H: can all form a bond that increases the stabilty of the protein. 
The goal of this project is to fold the given proteins with maximal stability.

## Getting Started
There are three subrepositories. 'Algorithms' contains random_sampler.py, hill_climber.py, sim_anneal.py, depth_first_search.py; the names of which reveal the algorithm. 'Classes' contains Protein_class_2D.py and Protein_class_3D.py, for protein folding in 2D or 3D, respectively. 'Experimentation' contains AOM.py (to determine the optimal amount of mutations per iteration, relevant for the hillclimber and simulated annealing algorithms), COOL.py (to determine the optimal cooling schedule for the simualted annealing), ALGOS.py (to determine which algorithm yields the best score given the samen amount of iterations and the same AOM for several runs).
Running main.py gives examples of output that you get in the experimentation files. 

### Prerequisites
