# Algorithms

To determine the optimal conformation of proteins (different in chain length and sequence), we have implemented several algorithms. 
* The random sampler folds the protein randomly, using the function protein.rand_fold(). The direction of the first bond is always to the right, to avoid symmetry. The second bond can only ever go up or down, also to prune some solutions. 
* The hillclimber folds a protein randomly on its first iteration. On following iterations, the direction of a number of bonds is mutated. Only if this yields a valid protein, the try is counted as an iteration. 
* The simulated annealing is an extension of the hillclimber. Here too, a protein is randomly folded and then mutated. Only, where a hillclimber can get stuck in a local minimum score, with simulated annealing two cooling schedules are provided in the algorithm, with a linear and a hyperbolic probability of accepting a deteriorated score. 
* The depth-first algorithm constructively folds a protein, thereby calculating every possibility. However, with chains > 13, the computer runs out of memory. Therefore, greedy choices are made to run the algorithm in reasonable time. Thereby the guarantee on the best score is given up.
