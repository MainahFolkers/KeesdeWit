    "A protein is a chain of amino acids. An amino acid can be **polair ('P')** or **hydrophobe ('H')**. Each amino acid is placed on a point on a grid. The amino acid chain can fold in angles of 90 degrees on the grid. The stability of the protein fold can be assessed with its **stability score**. For each H-bond (two unconnected hydrophobe amino acids next to each other on the grid) the stability score is decreased by 1. The lowest stability score signals the most stable protein folding."
